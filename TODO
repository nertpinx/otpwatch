Here's a list of bugs and/or needed improvements.

Timezone support:

  You either have to re-sync the token or wait till you get to your
  original timezone in order for this to work.  This should actually
  be only a problem of the basalt build since time() works properly on
  aplite!

Batterry charging overlay:

  The "lightning" that gets layed over the battery icon when the
  watches are being charged should have 1px black border (margin), but
  it currently overlays the whole rectangle.
